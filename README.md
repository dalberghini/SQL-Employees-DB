# SQL-Employees-DB

All required SQL queries are in Employee_Database_Queries.sql. Table creation was put into a separate sql file, Employee_Database_Table_Creation.sql. Views were created for each question in the query file. 

This was done to limit having to import the csv files into the tables everytime. 

Bonus is in Employee_Database.ipynb. The os.environ method was used to hide the password with the .env file put into the git ignore. PNG files of the tables are provided in the data folder in case the password protection fails.
